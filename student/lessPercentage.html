    <h1>Importance of attendance percentage</h1>

    <div>
        <h3>Why should we maintain our attendance(%) above 75%?</h3>
        <p>If you do not maintain your attendance percentage above 75% then there is a chance that you will asked
            to pay condonation fee which is levied on you by your college administration only when the attendance percentge is between 65% to 75% 
            and the amount is usually set by the college or the university. If your attendace is below 65% then you will be detained for that semester.
        </p>

        <h3>Why strictness on attendance?</h3>
        <p>Colleges and even schools rely heavily on attendance as the students need to follow a strict schedule and adhere to it. 
            When going to college or school regularly learning occurs continuously and students can learn systematically.
        </p>

    <div>
        <h3>When is the condonation fee used?</h3>
        <p>This fee is used sparingly and only in medical emergencies. This is done per the rules and the cause is approved by the university. 
            The student with less attendance is required to get his case approved by the university, pay a fee, and then only he is allowed to sit for the examination. 
            The universities must maintain a strict vigil to ascertain that this rule is not misused by repeat 
            offenders and only candidates with causes that hold merit avail of this option.
